## Overview

âœ¨ Effortlessly create versions or restore previous states of your image project data. 
<br>ðŸª™ Available exclusively for **Pro** and <span style="color:#96f">**Enterprise**</span> subscribers.

## How to Run

The application works in two modes: **Create** and **Restore**. Depending on the selected action, the application is launched within the project under the Versions tab.

### **Create Mode**

In Create mode, you can manually specify the **Name** and **Description** of the version, which helps in identifying the state of the project at the time the version was created. <br>Some applications can create versions automatically, using their own **Name** and **Description** that make them easily recognizable.

### **Restore Mode**
In Restore mode, you need to specify the **Version** number from which you want to create a new project. The state of this new project will match that version.
